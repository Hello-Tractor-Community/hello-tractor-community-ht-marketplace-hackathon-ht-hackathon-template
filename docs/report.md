- **Challenges**: 
    -Time Constraints
    Limited time prevented us from completing key features. Had to prioritize developing a functional homepage to meet the submission deadline.
    Incomplete backend API integration, requiring the use of mock data for dynamic product display.
    Ambitious project goals given the hackathon timeframe, requiring us to simplify and defer some features.
- **Lessons Learned**:
-     Get it done: Focus on delivering the core functionality first, and iterate later for more advanced features.
      Team Communication: Collaboration between frontend and backend teams is crucial for better alignment. 
      Importance of Planning: Planning a realistic scope and timeline would have helped achieve more within the time limit. And planning all the important to not cause more work later on.
